Temperature (°C),temp,50,"Water temperature is an important parameter that influences the physical, chemical, and biological processes in lakes. During the summer months, Upper Saranac Lake thermally stratifies, meaning there is warm water at the surface and cold water at the bottom. Stratification is driven by the absorption of the sun's energy at the surface of the lake and the density properites of water. This allows organisms with different thermal tolerances to find areas of the lake that are most suitable for them. For example, Lake Trout prefer temperatures below 16 °C and are therefore found in deeper waters in the summer. Additionally, thermal stratification cuts off the cold bottom waters from exchanging oxygen with the atmosphere, resulting in oxygen depletion through the stratified period."
Conductivity (μS/cm @ 25°C),cond,50,"Conductivity—the ability of water to pass an electrical current because of the presence of dissolved ions—is often called the “watchdog” environmental test since it is informative and easy to perform. Calculations of specific conductance standardize conductivity measurements to the temperature of 25 °C for the purposes of comparison. Rain, erosion, snow melt, runoff carrying livestock waste, failing septic systems, and road salt raise conductivity because of the presence of ions such as chloride, phosphate, nitrite etc. Oil spills lower water conductivity. Temperature, shade, sunlight, and sampling depth all affect conductivity. A conductivity probe does not identify the specific ions in a water sample—it simply measures the level of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the water body. "

Dissolved Oxygen (% Saturation),ODO.percent,50,"The primary sources of dissolved oxygen in lakes occur through diffusion from the atmosphere and primary production. Dissolved oxygen is consumed through respiration and decomposition. The solubility of oxygen in water is directly related to temperature and salinity, and decreases as both increase. Oxygen is vital to aerobic forms of life such as aquatic insects, zooplankton, and fish. Oxygen availability from the atmosphere and primary production vary throughout the year. During periods of lake turnover (spring and fall), oxygen is redistributed throughout the water column. During the summer stratified period, warm water at the surface of the lake prevents the cold bottom waters from mixing and cuts off the source of atmospheric oxygen. % saturation of dissolved oxygen represents the proportion of oxygen dissolved in water compared to the total amount that could be dissolved at that particular temperature and pressure. Water can hold more oxygen at colder temperatures than it can at warmer temperatures."
Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L),ODO,50,"The primary sources of dissolved oxygen in lakes occur through diffusion from the atmosphere and primary production. Dissolved oxygen is consumed through respiration and decomposition. The solubility of oxygen in water is directly related to temperature and salinity, and decreases as both increase. Oxygen is vital to aerobic forms of life such as aquatic insects, zooplankton, and fish. Oxygen availability from the atmosphere and primary production vary throughout the year. During periods of lake turnover (spring and fall), oxygen is redistributed throughout the water column. During the summer stratified period, warm water at the surface of the lake prevents the cold bottom waters from mixing and cuts off the source of atmospheric oxygen. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in mg/L is what is most important to organisms such as Lake Trout, which prefer concentrations above 6 mg/L. At concentrations below 4 mg/L we consider the water to be hypoxic, meaning there is likely physiological stress on many aquatic organisms. At concentrations below 2 mg/L we consider the water anoxic, meaning there is not enough oxygen to support most forms of aerobic aquatic life."
pH,pH,50,"pH is an index of hydrogen ion activity in solution, it is defined as the logarithm of the reciprocal of the concentration of free hydrogen ions in solution. Therefore, high pH values represent lower hydrogen ion concentrations than low pH values, and there is a 10-fold difference in concentration across a single pH unit. The pH scale extends from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Shifts in pH can have major effects on the dominants chemical and biological processes present within a lake. Many organisms have narrow pH tolerances, resultingi n significant declines in individual health and population numbers if pH values stray outside of their tolerances. Changes in pH also influence the mobility of ions and heavy metals which can result in issues related to nutrient availability and toxicity. Generally, pH values between 6 and 8 are considered healthy for Adirondack lakes. "
pH (mV),pH.mV,50,
Turbidity (NTU),turbidity,50,"Turbidity is a measure of cloudy water is. Higher values equate to greater cloudiness. Elevated turbidity can be caused by many factors, including sediment, algae, plant matter, and dissolved chemicals. "
Phycocyanin (RFU),bga.pc.rfu,50,"Phycocyanin is an accessory photosynthetic pigment to chlorophyll found in cyanobacteria. It is used to estimate the relative abundance of cyanobacteria in the water column. Cyanobacteria are a natural part of lake biological communities, but some species are capable of producing dangerous and deadly cyanotoxins. Cyanobacterial blooms are often referred to as harmful algal blooms (HABs) because of these toxins and the impact of lake uses. "

Chlorophyll (RFU),chl.rfu,50,"Chlorophyll is the primary photosynthetic pigment in all photosynthetic organisms, including algae and cyanobacteria. The concentration of chlorophyll is used as an index for algal biomass, or productivity. Nutrient concentrations, light, and water temperature all control algal productivity. Depending on the time of year, these three variables change and can limit algal production. Therefore, we expect to see variability in chlorophyll throughout the year and through the water column. You may observe peaks in chlorophyll-a near the thermocline as this is an area of optimal balance between light, nutrients, and temperature. Chlorophyll is measured using flourimetry and the unit presented here is relative fllourescence unit (RFU) values which are strongly correlated with concentration (μg/L)."
